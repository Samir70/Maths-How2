    <div id="description">
        <p>After you have learnt how to label a triangle,
            you have to choose one the trig functions: Sine, Cosine or Tangent. <br>
            These are the sin, cos and tan buttons on your calculator.<br>
            This page will show you multiple choice questions so you can practise this skill. <br>
            (If you want help with labelling a triangle see the <a href="LableSides.html">previous lesson</a>)
        </p>
        <div v-if="showInfo" id="quickDefs">
            <p>Captain Obvious: a triangle has three sides. <br>
                What you have to remember is that each trig function only talks about two of those sides. <br>
                Which two sides? That is something you have to memorise, <br> 
                and we use the made up phrase SOH CAH TOA to help remember.
            </p>
            <p>In the <a href="LableSides.html">previous lesson</a>, 
                you learnt that we call the three sides of the triangle: Opposite, Adjacent and Hypotenuse.<br>
                Let's pick two of those sides: the Opposite and Hypotenuse.<br>
                Their initials are OH. Look through SOH CAH TOA.<br>
                One of those words ends in OH, and begins with S. So those two sides are linked by the Sine function.
            </p>
            <p>See if you can work out the rest.<br>
                For some questions you may have to swap the order of the sides in order to use SOH CAH TOA.
            </p>
            <multi-choice 
                v-bind:q-list="qArray" 
                v-bind:firstq="startQ" 
                v-bind:show-pic="false"
                correct-ans-prefix="Well done! Those sides are connected by "
                wrong-ans-prefix="Wrong! Those sides are connected by " >
            </multi-choice>
        </div>
        <br>
        <button v-on:click='showInfo = !showInfo'>
            {{showInfo ? hideLesson : showLesson}}
        </button>
    </div>
    <script>
        var startQ = 0;
        var quickTeach = new Vue({
            el: "#description",
            data: {
                showLesson: "Show a quick lesson for using SOH CAH TOA",
                hideLesson: "Hide the lesson",
                showInfo: false,
                qArray: sohcahtoaQs, 
                startQ
            }
        })
    </script>


    <p>The above lesson lets you practise using SOH CAH TOA to find the right function if you
        know which two sides the question asks you two to consider. In the below exercise, you can practise
        working out for yourself the name of those two sides.
    </p>
    <div id="question">
        <p>Two sides are indicated in this triangle. One by showing its length,
             the other is the side you are asked for.</p>
        <multi-choice 
            v-bind:q-list="qArray" 
            v-bind:firstq="startQ" 
            v-bind:show-pic="true"
            correct-ans-prefix="That's right, the two sides are the "
            wrong-ans-prefix="Wrong! The two sides are the " >
        </multi-choice>
