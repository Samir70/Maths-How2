    <div id="description">
        <p>After you have learnt how to label a triangle,
            you have to choose one the trig functions: Sine, Cosine or Tangent. <br>
            These are the sin, cos and tan buttons on your calculator.<br>
            This page will show you multiple choice questions so you can practise this skill.</p>
        <div v-if="showInfo" id="quickDefs">
            <p>Captain Obvious: a triangle has three sides. <br>
                What you have to remember is that each trig function only talks about two of those sides. <br>
                Which two sides? That is something you have to memorise, <br> 
                and we use the made up phrase SOH CAH TOA to help remember.
            </p>
            <p>In the <a href="LableSides.html">previous lesson</a>, 
                you learnt that we call the three sides of the triangle: Opposite, Adjacent and Hypotenuse.<br>
                Let's pick two of those sides: the Opposite and Hypotenuse.<br>
                Their initials are OH. Look through SOH CAH TOA.<br>
                One of those words ends in OH, and begins with S. So those two sides are linked by the Sine function.
            </p>
            <p>See if you can work out the rest.<br>
                For some questions you may have to swap the order of the sides in order to use SOH CAH TOA.
            </p>
