        <p>After you have learnt how to label a triangle,
            you have to choose one of the trig functions: Sine, Cosine or Tangent. <br>
            These are the sin, cos and tan buttons on your calculator.<br>
            This page will show you multiple choice questions so you can practise this skill. <br>
            (If you want help with labelling a triangle see the <a href="LableSides.html">previous lesson</a>)

        <p>Captain Obvious: a triangle has three sides. <br>
            What you have to remember is that each trig function only talks about two of those sides. <br>
            Which two sides? That is something you have to memorise, <br>
            and we use the made up phrase SOH CAH TOA to help remember.
        </p>
        <p>In the <a href="LableSides.html">previous lesson</a>,
            you learnt that we call the three sides of the triangle: Opposite, Adjacent and Hypotenuse.<br>
            Let's pick two of those sides: the Opposite and Hypotenuse.<br>
            Their initials are OH. Look through SOH CAH TOA.<br>
            One of those words ends in OH, and begins with S. So those two sides are linked by the Sine function.
        </p>
        <p>See if you can work out the rest.<br>
            For some questions you may have to swap the order of the sides in order to use SOH CAH TOA.
        </p>
        <multi-choice class="question" 
            v-bind:q-list="qArray" 
            v-bind:firstq="startQ" 
            v-bind:show-pic="false"
            correct-ans-prefix="Well done! Those sides are connected by "
            wrong-ans-prefix="Wrong! Those sides are connected by ">
        </multi-choice>
    </div>
    <script>
        var startQ = 0;
        var sctQs = new Vue({
            el: "#sohcahtoaqs",
            data: {
                qArray: sohcahtoaQs,
                startQ
            }
        })
    </script>


    <p>The above exercise told you which two sides to consider. <br>
        In the below exercise, you can practise working out for yourself the name of those two sides.
    </p>
    <div id="question1" class="question">
        <p>Two sides are indicated in this triangle: one by showing its length,
            the other is the side you are asked to find.</p>
        <multi-choice 
            v-bind:q-list="qArray" 
            v-bind:firstq="startQ" 
            v-bind:show-pic="true"
            correct-ans-prefix="That's right, the two sides are the " 
            wrong-ans-prefix="Wrong! The two sides are the ">
        </multi-choice>
    </div>
    <script>
        var startQ = Math.floor(Math.random() * indicatedSidesQs.length)
        const askQ1 = new Vue({
            el: "#question1",
            data: { qArray: indicatedSidesQs, startQ }
        })
    </script>
    <p>Finally: do both at the same time.</p>
    <div id="question2" class="question">
        <p>Two sides are indicated in this triangle, just as above. <br>
            Find the trig function which connects them.
        </p>
        <multi-choice 
            v-bind:q-list="qArray" 
            v-bind:firstq="startQ" 
            v-bind:show-pic="true"
            correct-ans-prefix="Correct! The two sides are connected by " 
            wrong-ans-prefix="Wrong! The two sides are connected by ">
        </multi-choice>
    </div>

        var startQ = Math.floor(Math.random() * sctFromTriQs.length)
